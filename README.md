Car Price Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the price of cars based on various features such as brand, model, year, engine size, fuel type, mileage, and more.

The dataset consists of the following columns:
Brand 
Model
Year
Engine_Size
Fuel_type
Transmission
Mileage
Doors
Owner_count
Price

Column Description:
Brand : Manfacture (eg.Kia, Toyato)

Year : Year of Manfacture
Engine_Size : Engine size in litres
Fuel_type : Type of Fuel (Diesel,petrol, Hybrid,Electric)
Transmission : (Manaul,Automatic)
Mileage : Total Kilometer/miles driven 
Doors : No.of. Doors
Owner_count : No.of previous Owners
Price : Price (Target)

Problem Statement:
  Objective of this data is to predict the price the price of a car based on its feature

Machine Learning type is Supervised Learning
 This dataset is suitable for supervised learning because it has labeled data, where the Price column is the target column we want to predict based on the feature like year,Mileage,Fuel_type etc.

Regression Type:
  In this dataset price is the target column which will arrived based on the features
  so target column will be consider as dependent column and value of the target column look like continous numeric values so it is regression type
